# MneGCL

MneGCL is a novel method proposed to address the challenge of sparse biological data. It selects strongly correlated nodes based on multi-view similarity networks and implements a new clustering approach. The model enhances its effectiveness in biological association recognition through neighborhood-enhanced contrastive learning.

# Requirements
  * Python 3.9 or higher
  * PyTorch 1.13.0 or higher
  * GPU (default)

# Data
  * Download associated interaction data of drugs and targets.
  * Multiple similarity calculations can be obtained through the iFeature and generate_features files.

# Running  the Code
  * Execute ```python main.py``` to run the code.

# Note
```
 Pay attention to the use of all files.
 Note the version matching of python files.
